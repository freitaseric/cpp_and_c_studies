# Hi folks!

This repository contains all of my C++ and C code that I haven't transformed into real-world projects.

## Explanation

> [!NOTE]
> This list is ordered from the first to the last project developed by me.

1. [calc.cpp](./src/calc.cpp): A simple calculator CLI that I made to learn `switch case`, `I/O`, and `C++ fundamentals`.
2. [fact.cpp](./src/fact.cpp): A simple CLI to calculate the factorial of a provided number. I managed to learn `recursion` with this project.
3. [agenda.cpp](./src/agenda.cpp): A simple contact agenda that I made to learn how to use `vectors` and `structs` in C++.
